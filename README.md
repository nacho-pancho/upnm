# UPNM -- a very small PNM I/O library

This library does not do anything but reading and writing PNM files.
Contrary to the larger and vastly complete standard NETPBM library, this one
cannot write or read or convert any other formats. Thus, it has no dependencies
other than the standard C library.
This makes it extremely simple, small, and portable.
